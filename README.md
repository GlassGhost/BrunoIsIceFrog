> Because he ran a Dota stat website, TI2 was planned was to have him off-camera
> just feeding stats to the hosting panel. At the event just before it started 2GD
> went to a bar with him and decided he was too great not to have on the camera so
> the plan was changed last minute to let him co-cast. Nobody knew his face prior
> to the event thus created the "conspiracy theory" of him being IceFrog.
